# Introduction

*hackUST2018 - Education Technology*

In many developed countries, there is theproblem of an aging population and the resulting generation gap between different age groups. This resulting generation gap escalates conflicts between elderly and younger generation due to less and less interactions and low empathy between these two age groups.

This application is a social tool to provide opportunities for the youth and elderly to interact and learn from one another. For example, the elderly are usually not as tech-savvy as the youth. Hence, the elderly might choose to learn some basic skills in that particular field.
