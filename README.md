In many developed countries, there is theproblem of an aging population and the resulting generation gap 
between different age groups. This resulting generation gap escalates conflicts between elderly
and younger generation due to less and less interactions and low empathy between these two age groups.

This application is a social tool to provide opportunities for the youth and elderly to interact and learn from 
one another. For example, the elderly are usually not as tech-savvy as the youth. Hence, the elderly might choose
to learn some basic skills in that particular field.

These are the features that it currently has:
	A log-in page
	Menu to choose whether to LEARN or TEACH
	A list of TEACHERS to learn from
	A list of SKILLS to teach

Additional features that can be added:
	A bulletin board to share experiences or to find new friends
	A messaging system between users

In order to increase engagement and retention of users, various features are to be implemented:
	Point System
		The main currency of the application. Points can be bought using real money or by teaching. These points 			can be used to learn new skills or obtain special promotions from partnered organisations and brands. 
	Membership Benefits
		Based on the frequency of teaching experiences, users will be placed into 3 tiers: bronze, silver and gold.
		A higher tier would enable the user to earn more from a single teaching experience.

It was developed using Android Studio IDE and can be run on an emulator running a minimum of Android API 26.
